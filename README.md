## extended-sky
Modifies vanilla sky so that it can be drawn below the horizon. Allows drawing of (almost) all of the sky. Small blind spot at the very bottom. This is good for full custom skyboxes.

## holo-minimap
Exemplifies rendering the scene twice (in an arguably cool way). Creates a second 3D hologram of terrain around the player in lower right of screen. Pseudo-random selection of frames to choose between renders.
