useful MC 1.17 vanilla shader examples

## extended-sky
Modifies vanilla sky so that it can be drawn below the horizon. Allows drawing of (almost) all of the sky. Small blind spot at the very bottom. This is good for full custom skyboxes.

Requirements:
- none

## holo-minimap
!!!PROOF OF CONCEPT!!! WILL BREAK IN MANY SCENARIOS (to keep the shader simple).
Exemplifies rendering the scene twice (in an arguably cool way). Creates a second 3D hologram of terrain around the player in lower right of screen. Pseudo-random selection of frames to choose between renders.

Requirements:
- Fabulous
